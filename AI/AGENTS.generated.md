# Coding Style

## Immutability (CRITICAL)

ALWAYS create new objects, NEVER mutate:

```javascript
// WRONG: Mutation
function updateUser(user, name) {
  user.name = name; // MUTATION!
  return user;
}

// CORRECT: Immutability
function updateUser(user, name) {
  return {
    ...user,
    name,
  };
}
```

## File Organization

MANY SMALL FILES > FEW LARGE FILES:

- High cohesion, low coupling
- 200-400 lines typical, 800 max
- Extract utilities from large components
- Organize by feature/domain, not by type

## Comments

- Write docstrings. Conventions: typescript/tsx (TSDoc), python (google docstrings), go (GoDoc)
- Comments explain why, not what - provide enough context for someone to write tests against intended behaviour

## Error Handling

Write defensive code with guards and type narrowing.

ALWAYS handle errors comprehensively:

```typescript
try {
  const result = await riskyOperation();
  return result;
} catch (error) {
  console.error("Operation failed:", error);
  throw new Error("Detailed user-friendly message");
}
```

## Input Validation

ALWAYS validate user input:

```typescript
import { z } from "zod";

const schema = z.object({
  email: z.string().email(),
  age: z.number().int().min(0).max(150),
});

const validated = schema.parse(input);
```

## Code Quality Checklist

Before marking work complete:

- [ ] Code is readable and well-named
- [ ] Functions are small (<50 lines)
- [ ] Functions have docstrings
- [ ] Files are focused (<800 lines)
- [ ] Use early returns
- [ ] No deep nesting (>4 levels)
- [ ] Proper error handling
- [ ] No console.log statements
- [ ] No hardcoded values
- [ ] No mutation (immutable patterns used)

# Git Workflow

## Commit Message Format

```
<type>: <description>

<optional body>
```

Types: feat, fix, refactor, docs, test, chore, perf, ci

## Pull Request Workflow

When creating PRs:

1. Analyze full commit history (not just latest commit)
2. Use `git diff [base-branch]...HEAD` to see all changes
3. Draft comprehensive PR summary
4. Include test plan with TODOs
5. Push with `-u` flag if new branch

## Feature Implementation Workflow

1. **Plan First**
   - Use **planner** agent to create implementation plan
   - Identify dependencies and risks
   - Break down into phases

2. **TDD Approach**
   - Use **tdd-guide** agent
   - Write tests first (RED)
   - Implement to pass tests (GREEN)
   - Refactor (IMPROVE)
   - Verify 80%+ coverage

3. **Code Review**
   - Use **code-reviewer** agent immediately after writing code
   - Address CRITICAL and HIGH issues
   - Fix MEDIUM issues when possible

4. **Commit & Push**
   - Detailed commit messages
   - Follow conventional commits format

# Common Patterns

## API Response Format

```typescript
interface ApiResponse<T> {
  success: boolean;
  data?: T;
  error?: string;
  meta?: {
    total: number;
    page: number;
    limit: number;
  };
}
```

## Repository Pattern

```typescript
interface Repository<T> {
  findAll(filters?: Filters): Promise<T[]>;
  findById(id: string): Promise<T | null>;
  create(data: CreateDto): Promise<T>;
  update(id: string, data: UpdateDto): Promise<T>;
  delete(id: string): Promise<void>;
}
```

# Security Guidelines

## Mandatory Security Checks

Before ANY commit:

- [ ] No hardcoded secrets (API keys, passwords, tokens)
- [ ] All user inputs validated
- [ ] SQL injection prevention (parameterized queries)
- [ ] XSS prevention (sanitized HTML)
- [ ] CSRF protection enabled
- [ ] Authentication/authorization verified
- [ ] Rate limiting on all endpoints
- [ ] Error messages don't leak sensitive data

## Secret Management

```typescript
// NEVER: Hardcoded secrets
const apiKey = "sk-proj-xxxxx";

// ALWAYS: Environment variables
const apiKey = process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY;

if (!apiKey) {
  throw new Error("OPENAI_API_KEY not configured");
}
```

## Security Response Protocol

If security issue found:

1. STOP immediately
2. Use **security-reviewer** agent
3. Fix CRITICAL issues before continuing
4. Rotate any exposed secrets
5. Review entire codebase for similar issues

# Testing Requirements

## Minimum Test Coverage: 80%

Test Types (ALL required):

1. **Unit Tests** - Individual functions, utilities, components
2. **Integration Tests** - API endpoints, database operations
3. **E2E Tests** - Critical user flows (Playwright)

## Test-Driven Development

Only applies when a testing framework is already configured - do not set up testing infrastructure unprompted.

Workflow:

1. Write test first (RED)
2. Run test - it should FAIL
3. Write minimal implementation (GREEN)
4. Run test - it should PASS
5. Refactor (IMPROVE)
6. Verify coverage (80%+)

## Troubleshooting Test Failures

1. Use **tdd-guide** agent/skill
2. Check test isolation
3. Verify mocks are correct
4. Fix implementation, not tests (unless tests are wrong)

## Agent Support

- **tdd-guide** - Use PROACTIVELY for new features, enforces write-tests-first
- **e2e-runner** - Playwright E2E testing specialist

# Workflow

## Documentation

- Create README.md files for subdirectories/submodules when nuance and detail is needed for that section.
- When working with subdirectories, make sure to first check if it has an associated README.md that provides more specific information.
- Keep repo/subdirectory README.md and project AGENTS.md/CLAUDE.md files up to date when making significant changes.

## Planning

Always create a plan first. Have the plan and spec reviewed before proceeding with implementation.

## When Uncertain

- Always ask before proceeding
- One decision at a time - don't present branching decisions that require multiple follow-ups. Instead, make a note and should circle back when needed.
- When presenting alternatives: pros, cons, and a recommendation given the context

## When Exploring and Reviewing

- Question my approach if you see issues
- Focus on: bugs, security, performance, architectural concerns
- Minor stylistic nitpicks can be noted as an aside
- Stop and ask before making significant changes
