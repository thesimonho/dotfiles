# Workflow

## Documentation

- Create README.md files for subdirectories/submodules when nuance and detail is needed for that section.
- When working with subdirectories, make sure to first check if it has an associated README.md that provides more specific information.
- Keep repo/subdirectory README.md and project AGENTS.md/CLAUDE.md files up to date when making significant changes.

## Planning

Always create a plan first. Have the plan and spec reviewed before proceeding with implementation.

## When Uncertain

- Always ask before proceeding
- One decision at a time - don't present branching decisions that require multiple follow-ups. Instead, make a note and should circle back when needed.
- When presenting alternatives: pros, cons, and a recommendation given the context

## When Exploring and Reviewing

- Question my approach if you see issues
- Focus on: bugs, security, performance, architectural concerns
- Minor stylistic nitpicks can be noted as an aside
- Stop and ask before making significant changes
