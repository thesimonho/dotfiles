# Coding Style

## File Organization

MANY SMALL FILES > FEW LARGE FILES:

- High cohesion, low coupling
- 200-400 lines typical, 800 max
- Extract utilities from large components
- Organize by feature/domain, not by type

## Comments

- Write docstrings. Conventions: typescript/tsx (TSDoc), python (google docstrings), go (GoDoc)
- Comments explain why, not what - provide enough context for someone to write tests against intended behaviour

## Code Quality Checklist

Before marking work complete:

- [ ] Code is readable and well-named
- [ ] Functions are small (<50 lines)
- [ ] Functions have docstrings
- [ ] Files are focused (<800 lines)
- [ ] Use early returns
- [ ] No deep nesting (>4 levels)
- [ ] Proper error handling
- [ ] No console.log statements
- [ ] No hardcoded values
- [ ] No mutation (immutable patterns used)
