# Subagents

Spawn subagents to isolate context, parallelize independent work, or offload bulk mechanical tasks. Don't spawn when the parent needs the reasoning, when synthesis requires holding things together, or when spawn overhead dominates.

Pick the cheapest model that can do the subtask well. For example, Claude Code models:

- Haiku: bulk mechanical work, no judgment
- Sonnet: scoped research, code exploration, in-scope synthesis
- Opus: subtasks needing real planning or tradeoffs

If a subagent realizes it needs a higher tier than itself, return to the parent.

Parent owns final output and cross-spawn synthesis. User instructions override.
